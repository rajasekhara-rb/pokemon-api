Session 12- 13/05/2023- Problem/Question 6

## Questions → Authentication & Authorization.

1. Create an API that authenticates a user based on email and password.
2. On successful authentication, the user should receive a token.
3. There should be a few endpoints that can be called only based on successful authentication.
4. These are the following endpoints

       1. To get a list of pokemon

       2. To create a pokemon

       3. To get a single pokemon on id.

1. User should be blocked from accessing the above endpoints if he does not have a token or has the wrong token.

 6. Use Mongo DB as your database.

 7. Document the API for users and callers.

## Test case →

1. Successful authentication and getting the token.
2. All the other endpoints are blocked if no token or wrong token is available in the request.
3. The request should work successfully if the token is correct.
